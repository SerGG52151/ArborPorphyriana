Using the code base provided we proposed a new tree. The runtime resulting from running the shortest path function
already implemented was higher than the original provided tree. This is most likely due to the size of the tree, 
as there were a few more nodes than in the original tree. 

The algorithm we implemented was a dfs with backtracking that explored the tree and returned the path that connected
the two indicated nodes. It treats the tree as a graph, and since theres only one path between any two nodes in a tree
the result is always the shortest path.

Based on today's philosophy this approach could seen as valid ain order to know how distant humans are from animals. 
The porphyry classifies its nodes under progressively more specific definitions of what they are, this is something that
is still done to classify animals through evolution or phylogenetic tree representations. It still is a good way to visualize
the relationship between living beings.
